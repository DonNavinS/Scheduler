# Scheduler
This application uses local storage to save text entered into the input field(s), and recalls this text when the page is refreshed. The saved text is displayed with a different background colour and text colour to differentiate between saved and unsaved text. The text can be deleted using the "Clear Schedule" button. This application also uses Moment.js the display the date at the top of the page, as well as to determine which time blocks are assigned which colour, so that the current time block is a different colour than both the past time blocks and future time blocks for that day.
